q1: The addresses printed are the same because they are created and then destroyed, because they go out of scope immediatly after they are called

q2:now it makes 4 regulars and then destroys them all because they arn't used 

q3:it prints 3 created addresses and then destroys 4, probably has something to do with copying and assiging done in the pair function

q4:default constructor is called, we print from main the exact same thing because we did nothing, then it goes out of scope and is destroyed

q5: 4 Regulars are created by the copy constructor and then destroyed in the right order

q6: all 4 are created, we edit 3 of them, then destroy all 4

q7:assiging is called once, exactly where it should be

q8: nothing suprising here, everythign prints like it should when called.  two are created, one copyed, two destroyed

q9: the copy constructor is in outuput 2 because it is declared as static

q10: I went with passing an address because that is how I see others doing it in examples online
